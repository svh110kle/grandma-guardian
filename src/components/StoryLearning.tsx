      content: `Once upon a time, there was a kind grandmother named Rose who loved using her computer to stay in touch with her family.

One day, Rose received an email that looked like it came from her bank. The email said: "Dear Customer, your account has been suspended! Click here immediately to verify your identity."

Just like the wolf pretending to be grandmother, this email was not what it seemed. The real bank would never ask for passwords through email, just like grandmother would never have such big teeth!

Rose remembered what her granddaughter taught her: "Always check twice, just like looking closely at grandmother's face." She called her bank directly instead of clicking the link.

The bank confirmed it was a fake email - a "phishing" attempt, like a digital wolf trying to trick her!

Remember: Just as Little Red Riding Hood learned to be careful, always verify before you trust suspicious messages.`,

      content: `In a small town, there lived a wise woman named Martha who received a phone call one day.

"Congratulations!" said the caller. "You've won a million dollars! Just send us $500 for processing fees and taxes."

This reminded Martha of the old fable about the golden goose. The greedy people wanted all the golden eggs at once and ended up with nothing.

Martha thought: "If I really won money, why would I need to pay to receive it? This sounds like the greedy people in the fable - they want my $500 and will disappear like smoke."

She hung up the phone and called her son to tell him about the suspicious call. Her son confirmed it was a common scam.

Martha learned that real prizes never require upfront payment, just like real golden geese don't need you to pay them to lay eggs!`,

      content: `Mrs. Patel was having tea with her neighbor Mrs. Johnson when she noticed her friend seemed troubled.

"I've been talking to a wonderful man online," Mrs. Johnson confided. "He says he loves me, but he's stuck overseas and needs money for a plane ticket to come visit me."

Mrs. Patel's heart went out to her friend, but something didn't feel right. It reminded her of the soap operas they watched together - the handsome stranger who wasn't who he claimed to be.

"My dear friend," Mrs. Patel said gently, "in all our favorite shows, what happens when someone asks for money before they've even met?"

Mrs. Johnson thought about it. "The person usually turns out to be lying..."

"Exactly! Real love doesn't start by asking for money. Let's call my tech-savvy grandson together. He can help us check if this person is real."

Together, they discovered the photos were stolen from someone else's social media. Mrs. Johnson's heart was protected, and their friendship grew stronger.
